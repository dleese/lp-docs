Service Requests
----------------

Service Requests/Incidents/Bugs can be raised in two different ways

1. sending an E-Mail to support@logipad.aero
2. using Logipad's Web Portal https://support.logipad.aero
3. using Service Hotline

The preferred way and our recommendation is using the Web Portal. The Advantage is:

-   available through Browser Window
-   all requests will automatically be pre-qualified
-   all requests will automatically be assigned to the correct development Team
-   priority can be set by the User

Web Portal
