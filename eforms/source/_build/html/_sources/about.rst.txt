About Logipad
=============

Initially, Logipad was developed upon a request of a customer: In 2002, the airline LTU commissioned us to develop an Electronic Flight Bag solution. Since then, Logipad has been further developed and improved as a valuabe solution for the aircraft industry.
In 2002, T&A Systeme, later known as Modern.Work, has been providing airlines with the inhouse-developed Electronic Flight Bag solution. In 2017, Modern.Work merged with DextraData, an IT consulting company and independent software vendor.
DextraData, located in Germany with offices in Essen, Hamburg and Munich, offers comprehensive expertise in IT services and EFB. Our aim is to implement and develop IT solutions according to customer requirements.
